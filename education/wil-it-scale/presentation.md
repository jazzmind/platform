# WORK INTEGRATED LEARNING

# @ SCALE TODAY

Providing Business Education in an Applied Context

<!-- Page Break -->

WIL @ Scale is...

* Not common today
– Examples like FASTRACK few and far between

* Highly desired
– Large student, industry demand

* Going to happen soon
– Same tech/economic drivers as MOOCs

* Via new business & delivery models
– Unis can’t keep doing what they’re doing

learning analytic-
driven, well
produced) is
disrupting
these areas

Competitive
advantages that can
be built on by
good WIL

<!-- Page Break -->

Why go to Uni?
Disruptable, weaker value Defensible, strong value

* To learn how to learn • Premium brand
* Foundation knowledge • Deeper connectivity
* Access to research – Social network
– Industry access

* Piece of paper
* Contextualized learning
* Party

<!-- Page Break -->

The contextual learning opportunity

* Tighter industry connectivity
– More employable students
– Quickly align business skill needs and curriculum
– Applied research & linkages

* Big draw card for students
– Access to a (local) industry network
– Personal story building
– Non “academic” feedback that is personally
transformative

<!-- Page Break -->

WIL is often WwRL
(work with reflective learning)

* The learning is rarely designed into the work
– Reflection is needed to retrospectively determine
if theory was actually applied
– Hard enough ensuring the work is meaningful;
actually ensuring opportunities for applied
theory?

* Fundamentally different approach needed if
the goal is to deliver on “INTEGRATED”

PYRAMID of KNOWLEDGE TYPE and EDUCATION FORMAT
Online Education (inc. MOOCs) are disrupting the bottom and middle...
But what about the top?
WIL

<!-- Page Break -->

Context, Facilitation, Content

* Businesses need to set the context
– Not every context is appropriate or will scale

* Facilitation is a specialty skill
– Neither business mentors nor academics are
automatically good at this without training

* Content is “easy” – it’s everywhere
– But linking it to the context is hard
– requires excellence in instructional design

<!-- Page Break -->

How to scale?

* University & Industry relationship
– Pilot-Co-Pilot
– Not Pilot-Passenger or worse... Pilot-Cargo!
– Needs a “middleman” to broker

* Get the economics right
– Technology needs to streamline admin burden

* Great instructional design
– Lots of experiments happening – need to collate

<!-- Page Break -->

What we’re doing

* WIL programs for nearly 1000 students/year
– Costs unis less than a regular course
– Top outcomes without eating up top academics time
– Up Next: Serious Games, ASX Growth in Asian Century

* We’re building a platform that can sit alongside
the MOOCs
– Industry bring context
– Experts (Academic, Industry) bring content
– Instructional designers create great experiences
– We make the interfaces transparent and seamless

<!-- Page Break -->

Summary

* Contextual Business Education / WIL is...
– Highly valued by students
– Highly valued by employers
– Not scalable under existing models

* Tech/economic forces driving MOOCs apply
– Greater global demand, focus on core value

* Watch for new business models
