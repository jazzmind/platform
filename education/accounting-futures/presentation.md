In this presentation I‚Äôll first set some context by looking at the challenges of WIL @ scale, then explore the technology-based disruptors to the current approaches and finally look at what the future contains based on engagement with educators at the forefront.

2014
400,000+ international students

115k ELICOS

2025

Why Experiential?
Resume ü°™ Network
Credential ü°™ Narrative
Students: experiences that build networks and narratives
Employers: more value, less hassle in participation
Educators: assure quality & control costs at scale
Scale ‚Äì online, global ‚Äì whereever the brand is extended

It‚Äôs not what you know‚Ä¶ but It‚Äôs not who you know any more either‚Ä¶ because we all know each other
But how who you know can connect and influence are important ‚Äì so network QUALITY is essential
What you can do is most important‚Ä¶
How well do you learn from mistakes?
Can you tell a good story?
I lost $1m in the first hour of my first internship
Can you get people excited? Inspired?
Can you teach us something new? Bring in a new view point?

Scale Challenges
Or ‚Äì why disruption is the only way

WIL@scale challenges
Quantity of appropriate opportunities
Support during delivery
Assurance of relevant learning
Industry participation cost/benefit
Many educators are trying to greatly increase WIL participation levels. But providing meaningful WIL at scale is very difficult.

The next slides will explore three major issues we regularly see with providing quality WIL at scale.

SME engagement 
Microprojects
Digital native WIL
Marketplaces
Research shows that the biggest factor in student satisfaction is the perception and level of support. But WIL is notoriously difficult to support. Many students don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôre struggling, or why they‚Äôre struggling because so many aspects of the experience are ambiguous and new. Other students want to have their hands held at every intersection and struggle with embracing the uncertainty. The result for many educators is substantial time spent upfront during program setup and then a overflowing river of problems near the end of the experience when it‚Äôs too late to fix them.

Creating a capability to deliver support ‚Äújust in time‚Äù means having granular visibility of the progress of all participants during the experience. To do this, the experience 
needs to be structured in a way that gathers relevant data frequently, without the data gathering process detracting from the experience.

The problem is exacerbated with business internships. Often educators are managing students placed in dozens of companies. Each company has a different project and way of managing that student‚Äôs project. The educator might provide some tools for the employer, but they‚Äôll only use them inasmuch as the tools fit within whatever they were planning on doing anyhow. This creates high variability between experiences, which is a support nightmare.

Just-in-time vs crisis time

Assurance
Project Learning
Employers-centric
Effort ‚â† Outcomes
Different Strokes for Different Folks
The majority of students are not going to be facing journal review councils ‚Äì they‚Äôll be facing an HR team and interviewers for a job. If ‚Äúassurance of learning‚Äù does not align with employer perceptions there‚Äôs a long-term risk of brand devaluation. A student getting a High Distinction in an experiential program should be seen by an employer as having outstanding demonstration of the skills that were emphasised during the unit. At the moment, there is no such correlation and as a result many employers place little value on university experience.

Experiential programs struggle with whether to assess on outcomes or effort. Both are important metrics. Combining into a single ‚Äúscore‚Äù does not help a prospective employer. Employers would evaluate high effort/high outcome students differently than low effort/high outcome performers, even though both might get Distinctions. Even more troubling, in some situations a high effort/low outcome student might also end up with a Distinction.

Each student also will have different learning needs for a given experiential program. One might be weak on teamwork, another weak on presentation skills. It is currently rare to see ‚Äúpersonalised‚Äù experiential programs where students, educators and experience providers select the competencies that the student needed to develop up-front and the assessments would adjust to track those specific needs.

Min. Time & Max Output
Timing Flexibility
The appetite for traditional ‚Äúinterns‚Äù is diminishing. Larger employers are scaling back their graduate recruitment programs. They are also cutting back on internal training of ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù for new hires, preferring to hire those who already have demonstrated these capabilities. There are also attractive competing alternatives ‚Äìwhy take an intern when you can get a team of MBA students as free consultants. For international students, it‚Äôs even worse. Many employers put international interns into the ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù bucket, under the belief that they are either not employable or too expensive to employ. 

Even if an intern has many ‚Äúwork-ready‚Äù skills, they‚Äôll require on-boarding before they can fit into existing project workstreams. This requires someone in the business to put aside their work for the benefit of the intern. For businesses without dedicated graduate recruitment teams (e.g. most Australian Small to mid-sized enterprises) this is either too hard or done at the transactional level, where the intern has no opportunity for applying or developing any formal skills.

The result is a disconnect between the potential for WIL opportunities and the actual availability of opportunities. As a result, only 25% of Australian students have a work experience during each year of their education, compared to 60% of Americans, where smaller student numbers and stronger alumni networks connect with small/mid-size businesses to create a larger availability of work experience opportunities. A MUCH lower minimum wage also helps.

The Disruptors

Tech Disrupting Education
Social Learning
Gamification
Mobile First
Marketplaces
Project Learning
Social learning uses collaboration tools to get students to create a communal experience where students help each other and educators simply guide and facilitate the learning process. In the extreme cases, the students are recreating the educational content in their own terms and language. See https://spoonfeedme.com.au/ for an example of students preferring to get the lesson explained by a prior year‚Äôs ‚Äútop‚Äù student than the lecturer. 

Gamification adds competitiveness to the learning process. The student is motivated to acquire a series of badges or achievements ‚Äì perhaps for bragging rights or because they confer some extra benefits either within or beyond the course. The ‚Äúgame design‚Äù approach is also highly applicable to experiential learning. Often in games you learn by failing and then starting over or reversing a bit. Good experiential programs provide opportunities to fail safely, adapt and try again.

Project learning takes the position that most WIL can be modeled as a ‚Äúproject‚Äù, from a project management/consultancy perspectives. There are milestones, activities, deliverables and evaluations. In a project learning approach the activity is the focus and the ‚Äúcontent‚Äù is a supporting resource to help achieve an outcome. For example, a Project Plan milestone might have a ‚ÄúTeam Charter‚Äù activity which is supported by topical content such as teamwork, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc. Rather than ‚Äúquizzes‚Äù with right/wrong, there are simulations which test the ability to apply the learning.
