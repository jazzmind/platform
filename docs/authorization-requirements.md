# Authorization System Requirements

## Project Objective
- **Project Type**: Stable MVP with Production Scalability
- **Primary Goals**: Implement flexible, package-aware authorization system with role-based access control
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with existing Next-Auth system, maintain package independence

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Role and Permission Management
- **Custom Roles/Groups**: System must support creation of custom roles with flexible naming
- **Permission Scopes**: Each package can define its own permissions (OAuth-style scopes)
- **Role Assignment**: Ability to assign multiple roles to users across different contexts

### 2. Package Registration System
- **Self-Registration**: Some packages allow automatic user access upon request
- **Approval-Based**: Other packages require admin or owner approval for access
- **Admin Registration**: System admins can manually grant access to any package

### 3. Meetings Package Use Case
- **Resource Ownership**: Meeting creators have full control (edit, delete)
- **Editor Permissions**: Creators can add other users as full editors
- **Viewer Permissions**: Creators can add users as viewers (meeting participants)
- **Limited Editor Permissions**: Creators can add users with booking-only capabilities

### 4. System Integration
- **Next-Auth Compatibility**: Must work seamlessly with existing authentication
- **Database Independence**: Each package maintains its own schema while sharing authorization
- **API Consistency**: Standardized authorization checking across all packages

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Authorization checks must complete within 100ms
- Support for caching user permissions
- Minimal database queries per authorization check

### Security
- Fail-safe authorization (deny by default)
- Audit logging for permission changes
- Protection against privilege escalation

### Scalability
- Support for thousands of users and hundreds of packages
- Efficient permission inheritance and role hierarchies
- Bulk permission operations

## User Flows and Behaviors

### Meeting Creation Flow
1. User creates meeting â†’ automatically becomes owner
2. Owner can assign editor role to other users
3. Owner can assign viewer role to participants
4. Owner can assign limited-editor role for booking-only access

### Package Access Request Flow
1. User requests access to a package
2. System checks package registration type:
   - **Self-registering**: Automatically grant access
   - **Approval-required**: Create pending request for admin review
   - **Admin-only**: Require system admin to manually grant access

### Permission Checking Flow
1. User attempts action on resource
2. System verifies user authentication
3. System checks user's roles and permissions for the package
4. System checks resource-specific permissions (ownership, assigned roles)
5. Allow or deny access based on combined permissions
