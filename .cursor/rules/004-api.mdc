# API Integration Rules

## OpenAI Model Usage
- **NEVER** change OpenAI models unless explicitly requested by the user
- Use `o3-mini` as the default model for all OpenAI API calls
- Maintain model consistency across the application
- Document model choices in comments for future reference

## API Configuration
- Keep API keys and credentials secure as environment variables
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Always use server-side API routes for external service calls
- Implement proper error handling and logging for all API calls
- Include request validation for all API endpoints

## Response Formatting
- Use consistent JSON response structures across API endpoints
- Include appropriate HTTP status codes for success and error responses
- Implement proper error messages for debugging
- Consider rate limiting for expensive API calls
- Add logging for monitoring API usage and performance

## Error Handling
- Implement try/catch blocks around all external API calls
- Return appropriate status codes (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors)
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages in responses
- Consider implementing retries for transient failures

## Examples

<example>
✅ Good OpenAI Implementation:
```typescript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "o3-mini", // Default model as per standards
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a helpful assistant."
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: userMessage
    }
  ],
  response_format: { type: "json_object" }
});
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ Bad OpenAI Implementation:
```typescript
// Arbitrarily changing model without explicit requirement
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4", // Changed from default without specific requirement
  messages: [
    // Messages...
  ]
});
```
</example>

<critical>
- NEVER change OpenAI models from the default o3-mini unless explicitly requested
- ALWAYS implement proper error handling for API calls
- ALWAYS keep API authentication data secure and server-side only
