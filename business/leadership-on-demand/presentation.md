Changing  landscape
Complex Environment: Global, faster, uncertain
Greater Inclusivity: Needs, wants, perception
Greater Competition: Smart, more for less
New Hiring Models: Depth vs breadth

Changing Landscape:
	- Complex Environment: Today's leaders are expected to understand how to work in difficult conditions - under pressure, across distance/timezones, through language/cultural barriers and with high degrees of ambiguity.
	- Greater Inclusivity: An increasingly inclusive environment means more opportunities but also means working with people with different career goals such as flexibility over promotion, and with people who have physical, mental or situational constraints. 
	- Greater Competition: Education is a pre-requisite, not a differentiator. There are an increasing number of people who are smarter, will work harder, and will work for less. Experience on it’s own is also not a differentiator. Employers take notice when learning from past experiences is applied to their business challenges.
	- New Hiring Models: Entrepreneurship can be a way to demonstrate experience and teamwork - getting “hired through acquisition” to google is considered a good exit now.

One of the most common killers in large innovation systems is the focus on the ideas themselves, rather than the innovators. Silicon Valley VCs know that the passion and experience of the team members is more important than the idea – the idea will probably change several times before something actually eventuates. That’s why good ecosystems nurture their innovators, knowing that one day they’ll probably do something amazing. Conversely, focusing on the idea leads to a view that anyone can execute on a great idea. Nothing is further from the truth. Getting from idea to reality takes a lot of sweat – the 99% perspiration vs. the 1% inspiration. Only someone passionate about the idea will have that energy. It’s very hard to get people passionate about ideas that aren’t theirs! 

Speaking of inspiration – innovators need role models. People who are willing to take on the system, try crazy things, show that innovation is possible within a given ecosystem. People who pick themselves up after a failure and launch right back at the problem, or tackle another equally challenging problem. What they don’t need are people saying “yeah, we tried that before, it doesn’t work.” People who criticize failures by saying “See, I told you that was stupid”. Many organisations have innovators who won’t innovate because they’re afraid that failure will destroy their career. Nothing kills passion faster than fear.

Finally, just shouting “hey, we’re innovative – look at this cool website and poster we made” doesn’t fool anyone. Deloitte’s CEO has been unflagging in his commitment to innovation for over 10 years. Today, everyone inside and outside Deloitte believes that their commitment to innovation is Authentic. Authenticity takes time and an understanding that it might be a long while before people believe in you. That’s tough on the ego. The need for “quick wins” and to puff up success to justify the investment is a manifestation of egotism. Real innovators just get on with it. There’s a joy and excitement in rolling up the sleeves and getting into the guts of an innovation. Sometimes that means doing jobs that are seriously beneath one’s pay grade. A culture that puts down innovators because they’re getting their hands dirty can quickly kill their passion for their work.

We cannot solve our problem with the same kind of thinking that was used to create them. – Einstein

So the first thing we need to do is create space for new types of thinking. This was the idea behind google’s 20% time concept – creating white space in which people can develop new thinking.

Different types of people will do different things with white space. The creatives will use it to explore completely new disciplines with the understanding that they’ll see new things which might be applicable to the core and adjacent problem domains. The executers might use it to clear their plate of day-to-day projects so that they can think about something new. The quants will need to learn about the risk and market conditions associated with an innovation so that they can build accurate models for something new. I play piano or guitar whenever I have a difficult problem. Usually after playing a Mozart piano sonata or Blues jam I’m able to come back to the problem and solve it quickly – without actively “working through it”. I have no idea why this works, but since it’s a lot more fun than starting at a laptop I’m not going to argue!

Red tape is where options become limited due to unwieldy constraints imposed by the business. E.g. Do something new and disruptive, but make sure it has no impact on any existing systems and looks and feels like everything else. In some cases innovation programs can be their own worst enemies here, by creating systems and requirements that consume white space time and turn it into paperwork and bureaucratic wrangling. 

But white space without urgency just becomes wasted time. The participants need to feel a sense of urgency – the business needs them to deliver something soon, because competitive pressures are significant. It shouldn’t be “crisis level” urgency all the time, but there must be an understanding that there is a short, finite window in which any particular innovation will be relevant. This connects back to passion. Passion without momentum leads to frustration. If an innovator gets excited and then engages with a system that drags its heels, the innovator will eventually give up. Not only must the innovator feel the urgency, but the people she engages with must also be supportive of the time sensitivity.

Contrast this with the concept of tenure – I’ve achieved enough that there is now no urgency… I’m “set”. Perhaps they’ve secured a 5 year+ research grant. Perhaps it’s a 1st year student who’s not even started thinking about work because they have 2-3 more years of school. Why should someone with a tenure mindset feel urgency? They know exactly what they’ll be doing for the next few years. Ironically, the idea of tenure is to create freedom and whitespace – so a proven academic isn’t forced to worry about job security. However this mindset can be used to shut down innovation. It’s critical that people with “tenure” attributes understand that blocking innovation might be personally effective in the short term, but could leave them sidelined in the future.

One of the consequences of “tenure” is that there’s less need to network or look beyond the scope of one’s current job. But great innovation happens in intersections – when a solution or approach from one discipline is applied to another. When understanding a problem in one domain allows deeper understanding or awareness of a related problem in another. Universities are amazing environments for cross disciplinary innovation because not only do the experts exists across so many domains, but they also have an obligation to regularly explain what they’re doing – called teaching and publishing. But how often do biology researchers sit in on computer science or mechanical engineering classes? Yet much of the upcoming innovation in robotics, haptics and other bio-engineering will happen in those very intersections.  By encouraging students and staff to stay in silos substantial opportunity for innovation is lost.

Innovators learn through failure. The more failures an innovator has, the more they learn about themselves, the problem they’re trying to solve, the team they’re working with and what their customers really want. Failing is the key to success eventually. Also, nobody wants to fail, certainly not for lack of effort or some other factor within their control. The problem happens when the institution doesn’t want to see failures either. They give innovators the option of dragging out a project, instead of forcing a decision. At Deloitte we gave innovators $10,000 and 3 months. They needed to come back at the end of 3 months with a report on how much they spent, what they accomplished, what they learned. If they came back and said, “we spent it all, failed, but learned the following” we’d happily give them $10,000 again for their next idea. What we wouldn’t do is give them another 3 months, even if they hadn’t spent all the money. 

When failure or success happens, it needs to be noisy. Innovators need to share their lessons learned with the broader ecosystem. Community knowledge around innovator is a key multiplier on outcomes. Australians still have some challenges in discussing both success and failure in a constructive manner. Success is tough to talk about because of tall-poppy syndrome. The good news is that this is on the wane with some exciting recent developments among the highly successful and an openness around investment and philanthropy. Failure is tougher. Aussies mostly avoid discussing their own personal failings. When the failures of others are discussed, it’s rarely in a constructive manner. A US entrepreneur will happily tell an investor about prior failures and why they failed. It’s a great way to demonstrate experience – they type that will prevent the same issues from happening again. I don’t often experience this type of “pride” around failures outside of the US entrepreneurship scene.

These lessons learned do not work effectively in a “lecture” format. Collaborative discussion is the best way for sharing experiences and innovation knowledge. However many conferences and events are still structured in the “lecture, Q&A” format. There’s very little time or space for the audience members to share amongst each other. The classroom isn’t the only thing that needs to be “flipped”.  The “publication” mentality is the toxic opposite. A one way, time consuming process which has to be “right” before anyone can see it – especially if the goal is to get the story “published” somewhere important. By the time other innovators might happen across the information it’s likely to be irrelevant. Innovators want to act, discuss and engage. They don’t want to work in a vacuum, so forcing them to share in a read-only medium is counterproductive.

Finally, innovation is rarely a solo act. It also rarely comes out of a homogeneous pool of skill and experience. That tends toward group-think, where the homogeneity creates social pressures to NOT think outside the box. Instead, great innovators operate within diverse environments. This means diversity of skills, knowledge, perspective, culture. Getting diversity of age, culture are gender are great ways to mix it up quickly, but only if the participants come from different parts of the organisation. Even an initially diverse group of people can lose their diversity of opinion if they work together on the same tasks for long enough.

In my personal experience, many of the greatest innovative teams I’ve known formed relationships before they started working on an “innovation” together. Either they connected at university or worked on projects together in the past. Note the natural tension between this point and the previous one – work together too much and you lose diversity. Don’t work together enough and you need to learn how to work as a team AND deliver a great innovation under pressure at the same time. That’s pretty hard. But even a team that self selects is better than a team that has been “assembled” for an innovation they had no prior part in. This comes back to passion – the team needs to get passionate. While it might seem like a good idea to create an “A Team” to tackle a great idea, it rarely works well in practice. The team just sees it as a project. If they do get passionate, they are likely to not be on the same page, spurning team dynamic issues. 

‘Its also very dangerous to try to proscribe to teams how they should approach the innovation. This is really common when there’s a “system” for innovation that everything needs to go through. Trust your team. If they’ve practiced together then coach them, but they know themselves best.

Finally, teams do have problems – often. Outside perspectives can be invaluable. Having mentors that can provide assistance, a sounding board or intervention can be essential to getting through the tough patches all teams go through. But definitely don’t let the innovators become isolated. Creating an “innovation team” off in its own little playroom might seem like a great idea – get them out of the day to day activities of the organisation. But it can quickly result in the team getting isolated from their stakeholders. It’s a balancing act between creating white space and ensuring access, but neither extreme is workable.

Conclusion
It’s about people and culture
It’s an art and a science
Nobody can lead unless they’ve failed…

Great innovation capability comes from having great innovators and a great culture of innovation. It’s not about having unique insights, lightbulb ideas or fancy technology systems for managing pipelines and portfolios.

There is an art to it – creating an environment that synergizes with its people, enabling them to create things that are special and valuable, without knowing exactly what those things will be! But there is a science too – there are things we know that improve the odds and things we know shut down innovation quickly.

You’ll never get rid of all the “kills” – it’s human nature. However the “Kill” side can assert itself strongly when an organisation/industry is undergoing massive change and disruption. This is the challenge universities face today. Changing global competitive landscapes, the impact of technology and the “value” of degrees are disrupting the university business model. Fear, alarmism, over-reaction, denial, paralysis and anger can lead to systems that create and  reinforce “kill” actions. 

For universities to truly embrace innovation the right hand must start working with the left. At another event your VC described his job as a caretaker of a graveyard - many people under him but nobody listening. Supporting innovation is more than words from the VC, DVCs and Deans. It’s more than running a few entrepreneurship competitions. There needs to be a bottom up acceptance that change will happen and that when it comes blockers won’t be tolerated. Yes, some people will find a life’s work threatened or invalidated by the new “order” – but sabotaging their organisation’s ability to survive to preserve a few more months or years in their comfort zone is pathological… particularly when that same energy can be spent becoming relevant to future organisations. Education and research is only growing in importance. The way it’s done will change, but the amount of work that needs to be done will only increase.
