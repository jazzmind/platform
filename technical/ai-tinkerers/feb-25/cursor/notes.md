We’ve kind of worked to a hybrid version here, which is neither chat or composer in its original form! All the modes should be much similar to each other, to summarise:
Agent - Fully featured, with tools
Edit - No tools, can only read and write to files
Ask - No tools, no read/write - discussion only
Yes, if you use the ‘Ask’ mode, Cursor will not execute any edits or tools. We primarily use Agent here unless you explicitly don’t want it to make any edits - we find the agent is smart enough to know if you just want to discuss, or if you actually want to make edits and changes.

You aren’t able to use any of the free models in Agent mode. If you try, you will be prompted to switch models or switch to Edit mode, which doesn’t have any tools.

Nope, Tab is free and unlimited with any paid plan.

This doesn’t sound right. Each prompt you do with a premium model uses 1 usage from your default allowance of 500. Free models and Tab do not contribute. If you find the AI is stuck in a loop, or not performing well, it may be worth starting a new chat session to start fresh!

The Gemini models are actually free, so shouldn’t contribute to your allowance

A premium request is exactly that - one query to a premium model. The only limitation here is the 25 tool call limit. If, in it’s reply, the AI uses 25 tool calls, it will be stopped to avoid it getting in a loop. If you choose to continue it, this will also use another premium request. Besides that, there is nothing that should cause >1 premium request to be used from your allowance.

7B. Again, if you ask anything to the AI, it will use 1 request, regardless of if it’s a new query, a follow-up question, or even responding to a question the AI has asked you.

7C. The amount of files you @ into the model, and any edits it chooses to do does not constitute any more usage. The only downside is that if you @ too many files, it may loose focus on the details within them - this is a downside of the underlying models though, not Cursor itself!
