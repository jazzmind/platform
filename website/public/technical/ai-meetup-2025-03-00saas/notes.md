# Presenter Notes for 00SaaS Presentation

## Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Test RevealJS presentation in the browser
- [ ] Prepare the demo environment
- [ ] Check that all links work
- [ ] Review speaker notes in presentation mode (press 'S')

## Key Points to Emphasize

### On Cursor
- Despite its issues, Cursor offers a unique approach to AI coding
- The combination of agent mode + rules is powerful when used correctly
- Don't get discouraged by early bugs and limitations

### On 00SaaS
- The template is designed to be a starting point, not a final solution
- Multi-tenancy is handled at the database and authentication levels
- Edge-friendly architecture is built-in from the start

### On Vibe Coding
- Be diplomatic but clear about the reality vs. hype
- Focus on how AI augments developers rather than replaces them
- Emphasize the importance of understanding the problem space

## Demo Notes
- When showing the demo, highlight how the template handles:
  - User authentication
  - Tenant isolation
  - Edge deployment capabilities
- If time allows, show a quick example of using Cursor Rules to extend the template

### Getting Started with Cursor Rules

To use these rules in your own project:

1. Create a `.cursor/rules/` directory in your project
2. Copy the rule files you need into this directory
3. Configure VS Code settings:
   - Search for "Workbench: editor associations"
   - Add: `*.mdc` â†’ `default`
4. Use Cursor with Agent mode to leverage these rules
5. When chatting with the agent, mention relevant aspects of your architecture to trigger the rules
