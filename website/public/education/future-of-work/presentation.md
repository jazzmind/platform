Why Experiential?
Resume ðŸ¡ª Network
Credential ðŸ¡ª Narrative
Students: experiences that build networks and narratives
Employers: more value, less hassle in participation
Educators: assure quality & control costs at scale
Scale â€“ online, global â€“ whereever the brand is extended

Itâ€™s not what you knowâ€¦ but Itâ€™s not who you know any more eitherâ€¦ because we all know each other
But how who you know can connect and influence are important â€“ so network QUALITY is essential
What you can do is most importantâ€¦
How well do you learn from mistakes?
Can you tell a good story?
I lost $1m in the first hour of my first internship
Can you get people excited? Inspired?
Can you teach us something new? Bring in a new view point?

What are we doing?
Helping educators increase the amount of experiential learning
Helping employers get more value out of participation
Using technology to enable scale
