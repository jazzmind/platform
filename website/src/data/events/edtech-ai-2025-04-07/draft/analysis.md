# Analysis of the EdTech AI Roundtable 
### prepared by Dr. Patrice Torcivia Prusko, Harvard University Graduate School of Education

> *AI Usage Statement*
> This analysis was generated with AI assistance at several stages. Initial notes from the roundtable were transcribed and synthesized using AI tools. These AI-generated summaries and expanded notes were then carefully reviewed, edited, and validated by human experts. Further research and drafting involved AI models, followed by rigorous human review to ensure accuracy, coherence, and alignment with the core insights from the event and related research. The final synthesis and recommendations represent human judgment informed by both the collaborative discussion and AI-assisted analysis.

## Key Themes

### **1\. AI is Reshaping Human Purpose, Not Just Roles**

(*Burnout ‚Ä¢ Strategy ‚Ä¢ Skills ‚Ä¢ ROI*)

* Educators face a deep *identity crisis*‚Äî‚ÄúWhat is my purpose if AI can‚Äôt teach?‚Äù

* Institutions must now define their value not as knowledge transmitters, but as *spaces of human development*.

* New strategies center on **capability cultivation**, not content delivery.

* Human skills like *problem solving, question asking,* *judgment, ethics, and connection* are reframed as competitive differentiators.

‚ÄúFundamental question: What will the world look like in 10 years and how do we reimagine teaching and learning to be more human, flexible and agile?‚Äù

---

### **2\. The Emotional Cost of Continuous Adaptation**

(*Burnout ‚Ä¢ Skills ‚Ä¢ Strategy*)

* **Rapid innovation \= rising burnout**. Educators feel overwhelmed, isolated, and increasingly cynical.

* ‚ÄúAI tool sprawl‚Äù and unclear adoption priorities amplify *decision fatigue*.

* Students also face *cognitive overload* and disengagement in AI-mediated environments.

* Emotional resilience and **wellbeing support** are now strategic needs, not HR extras.

‚ÄúAccelerating pace of change overwhelming adaptation capacity.‚Äù

---

### **3\. Redefining ROI: Beyond Cost Savings to Human Value**

(*ROI ‚Ä¢ Burnout ‚Ä¢ Strategy*)

* ROI now includes:

  * **Educator morale and retention**

  * **Enhanced learner relationships**

  * **Organizational capacity to absorb change**

* There's a tension between ‚Äúquick wins‚Äù and deep, long-term transformation.

* Sustainable AI strategy requires investing in *people readiness* as much as *technical capability*.

‚ÄúPressure to demonstrate quick returns potentially limiting strategic vision.‚Äù

---

### **4\. Strategic Innovation Must Honor Human Limits**

(*Burnout ‚Ä¢ Strategy ‚Ä¢ ROI*)

* Thoughtful implementation is emerging as a *competitive advantage*.

* Institutions benefit from dual-track adoption: experimental \+ core operations.

* Strategic clarity around *what to adopt, when, and why* helps reduce burnout and guide investment.

‚ÄúMatch implementation speed to organizational absorption capacity.‚Äù

---

### **5\. The Human-AI Partnership is the New Pedagogical Model**

(*Skills ‚Ä¢ Strategy ‚Ä¢ ROI*)

* Future-ready education is about *human-AI collaboration*, not replacement.

* Roles evolve: educators as **orchestrators, facilitators, evaluators**.

* Skills needed include **prompting, oversight, judgment**, and **bias recognition**.

* Assessment must evolve to measure *capability in hybrid environments*.

‚ÄúAgent as collaborator. Agent as orchestrator.‚Äù

---

### **6\. Skills of the Future are Human-Centered and System-Aware**

(*Skills ‚Ä¢ Strategy ‚Ä¢ ROI*)

* Core rising skills:

  * Ethics and philosophy

  * Systems thinking

  * Empathetic communication

  * Facilitation and curation

  * AI fluency and judgment

* Shift away from routine content mastery to **adaptive capability development**.

* **Soft skills \= hard ROI** when aligned with AI use.

‚ÄúCritical thinking, collaboration, and creativity are the new core curriculum.‚Äù

---

### **7\. AI Strategy is Shaped by Burnout, Not Just Opportunity**

(*Strategy ‚Ä¢ Burnout ‚Ä¢ Skills*)

* Unmanaged change depletes energy and undermines innovation potential.

* Leaders must balance:

  * Bold experimentation

  * Protection of human energy

  * Strategic clarity around value

* **Burnout metrics** are emerging as key performance indicators in AI rollouts.

‚ÄúRecognize human energy as a finite, valuable resource.‚Äù

---

### **8\. Ethics and Policy Lag Behind‚ÄîBut Must Lead**

(*Strategy ‚Ä¢ Skills ‚Ä¢ ROI*)

* Ethics and governance need to catch up with the speed of innovation.

* Institutions must:

  * Build *AI literacy* that includes ethical decision-making

  * Create *inclusive development models*

  * Lead with *policy frameworks* that protect identity, agency, and access

‚ÄúPolicy should be leading this‚Äînot following it.‚Äù

---

### **9\. Strategic Investments that Yield Long-Term Value**

(*ROI ‚Ä¢ Strategy ‚Ä¢ Skills*)

* High-return bets (despite uncertain ROI metrics):

  * Data quality and governance infrastructure

  * Cross-disciplinary curriculum reform

  * AI fluency at all levels

  * AI-enhanced personalization \+ human coaching

* ROI strategies now demand *multi-dimensional*, human-centered evaluation.

‚ÄúLearning ROI is distinct from technological ROI.‚Äù
