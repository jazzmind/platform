# AI in Education and EdTech Roundtable - April 2025

In April 2025, a roundtable of 40+ educators, EdTech executives, AI experts, and academic leaders convened in Boston under the Chatham House Rule to discuss how AI is changing education. The following document synthesizes insights from that event with recent academic research (2022–2025) and conference proceedings, offering guidance for EdTech CEOs and other industry innovators.

## Policy Paper for EdTech CEOs (Industry Innovators)

### Overview and Industry Context 
The educational technology industry is experiencing an AI-driven upheaval. Generative AI and adaptive learning algorithms promise new capabilities, from intelligent tutoring to automated content creation, fueling what many see as a revolution in EdTech products. According to a 2024 McKinsey global survey, 65% of companies were regularly using generative AI – nearly double the share from the previous year – and 75% expected AI to disrupt their industries significantly in coming years[1]. In education, this broader AI surge has translated into intense **competitive pressure** on EdTech firms: as roundtable participants noted, "we can't not do it" – there is a compulsion to ship AI features *ready or not*, driven by fear of being leap-frogged by competitors[2]. Indeed, many organizations felt they had "no other option" but to implement AI, even when unsure of the long-term value[3]. This environment presents a dual challenge for EdTech CEOs: to innovate rapidly with AI in order to stay relevant in the market, while also ensuring product quality, educational efficacy, and ethical integrity are not sacrificed in the rush. This policy paper focuses on strategies around product innovation, market implications, and partnerships with the education sector, offering CEOs a roadmap for navigating the AI in EdTech era.

### Driving Product Innovation with AI 
**Embed AI Thoughtfully into Learning Products:** AI can enable powerful new features – personalized learning paths, AI tutoring chatbots, automated grading and feedback, content recommendation engines, etc. However, CEOs should ensure these innovations are grounded in sound pedagogical design and research. The goal is to solve real problems for educators and learners, rather than adding AI for buzz. For example, an AI tutoring system should be developed in consultation with learning scientists and teachers to ensure it aligns with curriculum and provides feedback that genuinely helps students learn (rather than just being a fancy gimmick). As one EdTech leader put it at a Stanford summit, the most effective tools *"empower teachers rather than making their job more difficult"*[4]. In practice, this means AI features should save time, reduce pain points, or open new educational possibilities – e.g. an AI lesson planner that drafts curriculum outlines for teachers to refine, or an AI language practice app that gives students instant feedback on pronunciation. It's wise to pilot new AI features with a small group of instructors or students and iterate based on their feedback. This co-design approach ensures that product innovations are user-centered. Professor Benedict du Boulay's keynote at AIED 2023 emphasized developing *empathetic and socially intelligent AI systems* that foster meaningful connections between students and virtual tutors[5]. Taking a cue from such research, EdTech products should prioritize human-like empathy, adaptivity, and responsiveness in their AI – to truly enhance learning experiences rather than just automate tasks.

**Balance "Quick Wins" and Long-Term Differentiators:** Investors and boards often push for quick AI wins – features that can be rolled out within months to ride the AI hype wave. Indeed, roundtable discussions noted an *"investment dilemma"*: quick wins are demanded, yet building foundational AI models or infrastructures consumes significant budget before ROI is clear[6]. CEOs must balance these pressures. A strategy is to incorporate some *"low-hanging fruit"* AI features using existing platforms (for example, integrating a third-party GPT API to add an AI writing assistant in your product – effectively **"renting AI until the moat is clear"**[7]). This can satisfy short-term market expectations. However, it's critical to concurrently invest in long-term AI capabilities that can become true differentiators. Perhaps your platform amasses unique educational data; leveraging that to train specialized models (with proper privacy safeguards) could yield an AI feature competitors can't easily replicate. For instance, a math tutoring platform might develop its own AI model tuned to how students learn algebra problem-solving, giving it an edge over generic AI solutions. CEOs should identify what proprietary data or insights their company has, and consider partnerships with research institutions to develop AI that's not just off-the-shelf. It was noted that **data quality > data volume** in driving value[8] – meaning a smaller, well-curated dataset of student interactions could produce better learning AI than a massive but noisy dataset. Thus, quality-focused innovation (even if slower) can win in the long run. As a rule of thumb: use commodity AI for non-differentiating enhancements, but build proprietary AI for your core value proposition.

**Continuous R&D and Staying Abreast:** The AI field is evolving incredibly fast – what was cutting-edge last year (e.g. GPT-3) is quickly surpassed by new models (GPT-4, etc.). EdTech companies should establish internal R&D or innovation teams to continually scout emerging AI technologies and experiment with them. Regularly attending AI and education research conferences (like AIED, Learning Analytics (LAK), or NeurIPS workshops on education) can inform your roadmap. For example, if new research shows improved student engagement with AI-driven **gamification** or AR/VR integration[9], an EdTech firm might explore those avenues. Some EdTech startups are creating advisory boards including educators and researchers to guide responsible AI innovation. Embedding a culture of experimentation – where developers and learning designers iterate on AI features and test them in real classrooms through pilot programs – will help your products stay cutting-edge and effective. In sum, treat AI innovation as a continuous cycle of *develop, deploy, evaluate, refine*, grounded in educational science. This not only yields better products but also positions your company as a thought leader in the space (which can be a market advantage in itself).

### Market Implications and Business Strategy 
**AI as the New Baseline (“Table Stakes”):** A striking insight from the roundtable was that many customers now expect AI features at no extra cost – AI is rapidly becoming a baseline requirement in EdTech, not a premium add-on[10]. In other words, an LMS or educational app without adaptive or AI-driven components may soon be seen as outdated. CEOs need to anticipate this shift: simply having AI is not a selling point if everyone has it; the differentiation will come from *how well* it's implemented and the outcomes it delivers. Additionally, monetization models might need to adjust – if AI features become standard, charging separately for them could be a hard sell. It may be wiser to bake AI into the core product and focus on overall value. However, offering **premium AI services** could still be viable if they deliver clear added value (e.g. a basic version of an AI tutor is free, but a premium version with more personalization and human tutor support costs extra). Market research in late 2024 showed EdTech investment rebounding largely because of AI, but also indicated that edtech buyers (schools, districts) remain budget-conscious after the pandemic-era boom and bust[11]. Many school systems will pilot AI tools but scale purchase only if they see real impact on metrics like student achievement or teacher efficiency. Therefore, demonstrating efficacy is key to market success. An EdTech product that can publicly share research-backed results – for instance, "students using our AI reading coach improved their reading levels 30% faster than those who did not"[12] – will have a competitive edge in convincing skeptical school purchasers.

**Competitive Landscape and "Arms Race":** With big players (established LMS providers, tech giants, content publishers) all injecting AI into their offerings, startups and mid-size companies must strategize smartly. One approach is **niching down**: focus on a specific problem or subject area and dominate it with superior AI. For example, instead of a general tutoring AI, a company might build the best AI for chemistry labs or early literacy, trained on domain-specific data and pedagogy. By solving a targeted need deeply, you can compete even as broad platforms add superficial AI features. Another approach is **complementarity**: integrate with the big platforms rather than compete head-on. If Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams is embedding AI, perhaps your product can plug into those ecosystems (e.g. an AI plugin that works within Google Docs to provide writing support). Partnerships or interoperability standards (like LTI and others from 1EdTech consortium) could allow your AI solutions to reach users on larger platforms. Market foresight is crucial: think about where AI in education is heading in 5+ years. Some participants predicted a future with personal AI "copilots" for every student and educator[13]. If that comes to pass, how will your company remain relevant? Possibly by being the provider of choice for certain AI skills or content packs, or by focusing on the human elements (community, mentoring) that pure AI cannot fulfill. Also, consider the global market – regions like Asia and the Middle East are investing heavily in AI education solutions. Tailoring products for different curricula or languages (and ensuring cultural bias is addressed) can open new growth avenues, but requires strategic investment.

**ROI and Sustainability:** During the ROI-focused discussion at the roundtable, a tension was noted: many EdTech firms are pursuing AI without clear evidence of return, partly out of FOMO (fear of missing out)[14]. To ensure long-term sustainability, CEOs should impose some discipline in evaluating ROI. This doesn't only mean financial ROI, but also **learning ROI** – are the AI features tangibly improving learning outcomes or customer satisfaction, which in turn drive revenue via renewals and adoption? Set metrics to track AI initiatives: e.g. usage rates of the AI feature, impact on user retention, improvement in learning metrics collected by the platform, etc. If an AI-powered feature isn't moving the needle on any key metrics, be willing to pivot or even sunset it, rather than keep sinking costs. It was also mentioned that many organizations are choosing to "buy vs. build" AI – using third-party AI services or models to save development costs[15]. This can be wise, but watch out for dependencies (if everyone is using the same general AI API, how do you differentiate?) and for costs that can scale unpredictably (API usage costs that balloon as usage grows). Sometimes investing in an in-house solution, though slower initially, can pay off if it reduces variable costs down the line. In terms of business models, AI might enable new offerings: e.g. **AI-driven analytics services** where you charge institutions for insights on learning data, or **adaptive content** subscriptions. Keep an eye on emerging revenue streams unlocked by AI, but validate them with pilot customers.

### Partnering with Educators and Institutions 
**Co-design and Feedback Loops:** One of the strongest messages from educators is that EdTech solutions work best when they are built *with* teachers, not *for* teachers in a vacuum. CEOs should foster a culture (and processes) of deep partnership with the education community. This can include forming educator advisory boards, inviting power-user teachers to beta test new features, and integrating user feedback cycles into product development. As noted earlier, teachers often invent clever uses for AI tools when given the chance[16] – involving them early can uncover killer features or necessary tweaks. For instance, a district might partner with your company to pilot an AI tool across several classrooms; in exchange for early access, they provide detailed feedback and data on how it performs, guiding improvements. Such partnerships build goodwill and increase the likelihood of broader adoption since those teachers become internal champions. Moreover, demonstrating that your product was co-designed with respected educators can be a selling point to other schools (it signals the tool is educator-friendly). EdTech firms might also collaborate with academic researchers to validate efficacy, as mentioned. Publishing joint case studies or white papers with university researchers can lend credibility and trustworthiness to an AI product's claims[17].

**Professional Development and Support:** Selling an AI-enabled product into a school or college is not the end – ensuring it is effectively used is crucial for renewal and word-of-mouth growth. EdTech companies should consider offering robust professional development (PD) and onboarding for their AI tools. This might include online teacher training modules, live webinars, or even on-site workshops (perhaps in partnership with local training organizations). By helping educators gain AI fluency and confidence with your tool, you increase its impact and the customer's satisfaction. Some companies are creating certification programs (e.g., "Certified AI Educator" using their platform), which not only trains users but also creates communities of practice. Additionally, provide ongoing support specifically tuned to AI features – for example, a helpdesk that can answer not just technical questions but pedagogical ones like "How do I interpret the insights the AI is giving me about my class?" The more teachers feel supported, the more they will actually use the AI (overcoming initial intimidation or skepticism). From a partnership perspective, you might work with a district on a staged rollout: year 1 focus on PD and pilot in a few schools, year 2 expand wider once success is proven. This aligns with the "sandbox to mainstream" approach educators are calling for[18].

**Building Trust through Transparency:** AI algorithms can be a "black box," and many educators are wary of tools they don't understand. To form strong partnerships, EdTech companies should be as transparent as possible about how their AI works and what its limitations are. This could involve providing simplified explanations or visualizations of the AI's decision process, or at least disclosures about the data it uses and the accuracy rates found in testing. For example, if you have an AI grading system, share information about its training (e.g., "trained on 10,000 graded essays, with rubrics aligned to Common Core") and advise teachers on how to double-check its outputs. By being honest that AI can err and showing how you handle those errors (like a mechanism for teachers or students to flag and correct a mistake), you build trust. In partnerships with schools, discuss data privacy and security upfront – for instance, clarify that *the school owns their student data*, and your company will not sell or use it beyond providing the service. Offering strong data protection agreements (compliant with FERPA, GDPR, etc.) and perhaps undergoing third-party audits (or joining initiatives like the Student Data Privacy Consortium or EdSAFE AI Alliance) will reassure institutional clients. Trust is a currency in education markets; companies that demonstrate ethical responsibility will likely form deeper, longer-lasting partnerships.

**Aligning with Educational Outcomes:** Finally, EdTech CEOs should ensure their partnerships are outcome-focused. Schools and universities have goals (improve reading proficiency, increase retention, reduce achievement gaps, etc.), and an AI product will be compelling if it tangibly contributes to those goals. Work with partners to set KPIs for the implementation of your product – e.g. "by using this AI homework helper, we aim to see 20% more homework completion and a 10% improvement in test scores in the piloting classes." If you meet or exceed those targets, celebrate and publicize the success together. If not, use it as a learning to improve the product. This outcome alignment turns the relationship from vendor-client into a true partnership where both sides collaborate for student success. It also helps counter the narrative that EdTech companies push technology that isn't needed – instead, you're jointly addressing a priority the educators identified. Successful outcomes will drive expansion (a pilot turns into a district-wide contract) and generate case studies to attract other customers. In the long run, this focus on educational value not only improves lives (fulfilling the moral purpose many EdTech entrepreneurs share) but also is sound business – it creates products that actually deliver results, which is the strongest competitive advantage of all.

### Ethical Leadership in EdTech 
**Embrace Ethical AI Principles:** As stewards of technology that impacts children and learners, EdTech CEOs carry an ethical responsibility. Issues like algorithmic bias, student data privacy, and AI's impact on student agency require proactive attention. Adopt clear AI ethics principles for your company – for instance, Microsoft's *responsible AI* guidelines or UNESCO's *human-centered AI* approach can be good references. This might include commitments such as "our AI will not replace teachers but assist them," "we will seek to mitigate bias and ensure fairness for all student groups," and "users will always have the ability to get human support or override an AI decision." Make these commitments public. Also, consider an ethics review process for new AI features (maybe an internal committee including an educator or external advisor). Demonstrating ethical leadership can differentiate your brand – schools will be more comfortable adopting AI from a company that clearly prioritizes student well-being over pure profit. It's worth noting that regulators are catching up: for example, the European Union's **AI Act** will classify many educational AI systems as *"high-risk,"* subjecting them to strict requirements for transparency, human oversight, and fairness[19]. Getting ahead of regulations by implementing robust ethics and compliance now will save headaches later and make your products globally adaptable.

**Monitor and Mitigate Unintended Consequences:** When deploying AI features, watch for unintended negative impacts. For instance, does an AI recommendation system inadvertently narrow students' exposure to content (the filter bubble effect)? Does an adaptive learning system over-prioritize test performance at the expense of creativity? Engage with researchers or use A/B testing to identify such effects. If issues are found, be transparent and address them. Perhaps give educators more controls – e.g. the ability to adjust the AI's recommendations or parameters. Keep humans in charge: one roundtable takeaway was that technology should *"serve us, not replace or take over"[20]. So design your AI such that teachers and students feel empowered, not controlled. For example, instead of an AI that autonomously assigns all homework, make it a suggestion tool that a teacher can easily modify. Maintaining this ethos will keep your products aligned with educators' values and avoid pushback.

**Collaboration, not Competition, with Educators:** In summary, the relationship between EdTech firms and the education sector must be symbiotic. Companies that see themselves as partners in the educational mission – rather than just vendors – will build stronger networks and reputations. As AI becomes more prevalent, it is even more crucial to keep educators at the center of the innovation loop, ensuring that what is built with cutting-edge tech also makes sense on the ground in classrooms and lecture halls. The future of EdTech will be written by those who can integrate the latest AI advances with the timeless wisdom of great teaching practice. By following the strategies above, EdTech CEOs can innovate swiftly **and** wisely, driving growth in the market while making a positive impact on learners and educators worldwide.
